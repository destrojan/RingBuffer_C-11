# Test Task find sub-collection 
> Find largest sub-collection algorithm in unsorted vector with givem sum of all elements 


Finding algorithm accepts T - erquired sum of elements, I - vector of in numbers (it acan be huge), S - sum of sub-collection elements, M - found vector, the one of the relevant sub-collection requirements.

Project contain tests for different collections,
and shows the results of the found sub-collections with the maximally to T.


## Installation

OS X & Linux & Windows

```
cmake .
make

```


## Usage example

 I = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
 T = 11
 
 result  of find  can be:
 S: 11
 M: 2, 4, 5 

## Development setup

on your system must be installed c++ compiler with std=c++14 suppot and CMake
